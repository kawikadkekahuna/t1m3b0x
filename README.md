Go do stuff, timer display progress in minimal way.

Text will appear if you wait a second.

<kbd>Space</kbd> will pause the Timer.

You may have noticed why its "at-a-glance".

If you're truly patient, you will get able to config (ðŸš§ WIP)

There will be <kbd>Keyboard</kbd> Shortcuts (ðŸš§ PLANNED)

The configuration will be more robust (ðŸš§ PLANNED)
